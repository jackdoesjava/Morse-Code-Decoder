# Morse Code Decoder with Raspberry Pi Pico (C)

This project involves building a Morse Code decoder using a Raspberry Pi Pico and C++ programming language. The system decodes Morse Code signals received from a button and provides immediate feedback through lights and sound, while displaying the decoded Morse Code in real-time on a terminal and a 7-segment display.

## Features
- **Button Input**: Pressing a button in specific patterns generates Morse Code.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Lights and sound provide immediate feedback for each decoded Morse Code input.
- **Terminal Display**: Decoded Morse Code is displayed on the terminal as it is processed.
- **7-Segment Display**: Each decoded character is shown on a 7-segment display for visual representation.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: The decoder handles real-time decoding and display updates.

## Components
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: The core controller for the project.
- **Button**: Input device for Morse Code signals.
- **7-Segment Display**: Displays decoded characters.
- **Lights and Sound System**: Provides feedback to the user.
  
## Skills Demonstrated
- Hardware assembly and component integration.
- C programming for real-time processing and interaction.
- Handling real-time data and providing user feedback through lights and sound.

## Project Workflow
1. **Assembly**: Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico, button, 7-segment display, and feedback system (lights and sound).
2. **Morse Code Input**: User presses the button in specific patterns to encode Morse Code.
3. **Decoding**: The program interprets the button presses and decodes them into Morse Code.
4. **Feedback**: Visual and audio feedback are given for each decoded character, which is displayed on both the terminal and the 7-segment display.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico, button, lights, sound system, and 7-segment display.
   - Ensure correct wiring for each component to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - Open the project in your preferred C development environment.
   - Build and upload the code to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

3. **Running the Project**:
   - Press the button in specific patterns to generate Morse Code.
   - The decoded output will appear on the terminal and 7-segment display.
   - Lights and sound will indicate the decoded character.
